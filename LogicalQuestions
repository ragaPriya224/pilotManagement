JAVA LOGICAL QUESTIONS 

STRING
1. Write a program to find the EB bill with the given inputs,
input1="abc2012345"
input2="abc2012660"
input 3=4
In the given input1 "abc20" refers to customer id and 12345 refers to the last month 
EB reading, similarly from input2 “abc20” refers to customer id and 12660 refers to 
this month EB reading.
Find the difference between two reading 12660 and 12345 and multiply it by input3.
Sample Output
Output=(12660-12345)*4
Output=1260


2. Find the max length-word in each string and return the max-length word. if 
two words are of same length return the first occurring word of max-length?.
input: "hello how are you Jenny"
output: hello(length-5)


3. Given a string, reverse the string and parse it with '-'.
input:computer
output:r-e-t-u-p-m-o-c


4. Given two strings, If the two strings are of same length concatenate them, if 
they are not of same length, reduce the longer string to size of smaller one, and 
concatenate them
input1:"hello"
input2:"hi" 
output:"lohi"


5. A number is given as input. Find the odd digits in the number, add them, and 
find if the sum is odd or not. If even return 1, if odd return 2
input:52315
logic:5+3+1+5=14(even)
output:1
input:1112
logic:1+1+1=3(odd)
output:2
----------------------------------------------------------------
ARRAY
6. Get two integer arrays as input, identify the common elements in the arrays
and find the number of common elements.
input1: {1,2,3,4}
input2: {3,4,5,6}
output: 4(3,4,3,4)


7. Given integer array, remove the duplicate elements and print sum of even 
numbers in the array.
input 1={2,3,54,1,6,7,7}

----------------------------
COLLECTION
8. Given the hashmap with registration number as key and mark as value. Find 
the average of marks whose key is odd.
input:{12:90,35:90,33:88,56:90}
output: avg of(90+90) =90

9. Given two hashmap h1 with employee id and designation and hashmap h2 
with id and salary, in a new hashmap the manager id and salary with the 
increment of 5000 must added and printed.
Input h1: {1="analyst",2="manager"}
Input h2: {1=2000,2=5000}
output: {2=10000}

10. Given a hashmap with employee name as Key and mark as Value, if the mark 
is greater than 75, then display Pass else Fail.
Input: {“Anu”:88,”Varun”:69,”Thomas”:76}
Output: {“Anu”:”Pass”,”Varun”:”Fail”,”Thomas”:”Pass”}
